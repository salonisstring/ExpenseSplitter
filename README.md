Expense Splitter System (Java)

This is a Java-based console application that fairly splits group expenses
when members have contributed unequal amounts.

Problem Statement:
When a group of people spends money together, each person may pay a different
amount. This application calculates who owes money and who should receive money.

Features:
- Accepts multiple members
- Handles unequal expense contributions
- Calculates equal share
- Identifies creditors and debtors
- Performs optimized settlement

Technologies Used:
- Java
- OOP concepts
- Collections (ArrayList)

Core Logic:
Balance = Amount Paid − Equal Share

Positive balance → person receives money
Negative balance → person pays money

Learning Outcome:
- Practical use of Java collections
- Real-life problem-solving using programming

- Improved understanding of loops, conditions, and objects
